# MyOwnGit
Recreate some basic git functions such as commit, pull, push etc...
I'm doing it purely for fun (and for a better understanding of how git works), thus, i will not create anything on my own (at least, not before i reach the end of the tutorial). 

A special thanks to the following tutorial [wyag](https://wyag.thb.lt/),
and to [Build-your-own-x repo](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).
